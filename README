README 

Written by Raphael Miller in order to get more familiar with git, github, and intelij. 

This simple program is a tile cost calculator. It collects user generated input for 
length and width of the "tile floor" and then presents a representation of the cost
based on already defined "cost of material" and "type of material". 

Simple text based UI. nothing fancy. essentially just a practice on algorythims. 
I did try to make it a little more modular then any of my previous projects in order
to get used to real world application problems. 

Any beginners like me out there want a deeper explaination on whats going on in my 
code feel free to message me via gitHub https://github.com/gemini88mill
